# Millennium Dawn: German Translation 
This is a sub-mod for the Millennium Dawn mod for the game Hearts of Iron IV that implements the German language into the game.

I'm excited to welcome any contributions and kindly ask you to point out any errors in the translations. Additionally, I would like to take charge of managing and initiating the project to ensure that all German-speaking individuals have a proper German language implementation for the mod.

## FAQ

#### What is the Millennium Dawn sub-mod?
The Millennium Dawn sub-mod is an additional modification that builds upon the content of the original Millennium Dawn mod for Hearts of Iron IV. It includes new features, gameplay mechanics, and focuses on specific regions or countries.


#### Who created this sub-mod?
This sub-mod is currently maintained by me, but anyone is welcome to contribute by submitting pull requests. It was originally created by a group of modders who are not affiliated with the main developers of the Millennium Dawn mod.

#### Why is the translation sometimes very poor or variables broken?
The initial version of the translation was mostly generated using Deepl, which resulted in inconsistencies and errors. We acknowledge that some parts may not meet the desired quality standards. However, we encourage you to open an issue on GitHub or contribute by fixing these issues yourself. We welcome all contributors to join us in improving the translation and making it more accurate and consistent.
