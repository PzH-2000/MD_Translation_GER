# Millennium Dawn: German Translation 
This is a sub-mod for the Millennium Dawn mod for the game Hearts of Iron IV that implements the German language into the game.

I'm excited to welcome any contributions and kindly ask you to point out any errors in the translations. Additionally, I would like to take charge of managing and initiating the project to ensure that all German-speaking individuals have a proper German language implementation for the mod.

## FAQ

#### What is the Millennium Dawn sub-mod?
The Millennium Dawn sub-mod is an additional modification that builds upon the content of the original Millennium Dawn mod for Hearts of Iron IV. It includes new features, gameplay mechanics, and focuses on specific regions or countries.

#### Who created this sub-mod?
This sub-mod is currently maintained by me, but anyone is welcome to contribute by submitting pull requests. It was originally created by a group of modders who are not affiliated with the main developers of the Millennium Dawn mod.

#### Current goal of the project
At the moment, the primary goal is to translate to a base. Some translations are certainly bad, as they are simply interpreted 1:1, and if necessary it works logically. But this project needs to grow to achieve its purpose. Then we can get down to the nitty-gritty.  Or as my maths teacher taught me: "A bit of cosmetics later, and it's fine".

#### Can the mod be used?
No. More than 80% of the content is missing, but to make it faster, catch and help! 10 lines of translation are 10 lines.

#### I have discovered an error!
Please report it immediately under Issues. Describe when and where it came from, e.g. NATO accession. My Country: Germany or KI start a war 2014 and captured the Crimea
